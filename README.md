# Next.js Form Validation

## Overview

With the introduction of Server Components and Server Actions, validation of form data is now possible on the server. However, there are still many use cases where client-side validation is necessary. I always liked the form validation combo of React Hook Form & Zod so I wanted to see how to intergrate this with Next.js's new paradigm.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js
- React Hook Form
- Zod
- Tailwind CSS
- Tremor (for the form)
